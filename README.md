## üìä Project Overview  
This project explores the **Melbourne housing market** through an interactive Tableau dashboard built on 20,993 property sales records. The dashboard provides insights into housing prices, property characteristics, and market dynamics using parameter-driven storytelling and interactive filters.  

Key features include:  
- Five dynamic visualizations (bar, histogram, line, and stacked plots).  
- A parameter that toggles between **Average Price, Price per sqm, and Number of Rooms**.  
- Interactive filters for **Region, Property Type, Rooms, Land Size, Distance, and Time**.  
- A unified dashboard displaying all visualizations for holistic analysis.  

This project demonstrates strong capabilities in **Tableau, parameter-driven analysis, and real estate market insights**.

## ‚è≥ Parameter & Calculated Fields  

- **Price or Room Selection Parameter**  
  This parameter allows users to toggle between three perspectives:  
- **Average Price**  
- **Price per sqm**  
- **Number of Rooms**  
  ![Parameter](plots/parameter.png)  

- **Dynamic Titles (Calculated Fields)**  
  Each visualization title updates dynamically depending on the parameter selection:  
  - Property Type  
  - Region  
  - Land Size  
  - Distance to Center  
  - Month  

Example of calculated field:  
```tableau
IF [Parameter Price or Room] = "Average Price" THEN AVG([Price])
ELSEIF [Parameter Price or Room] = "Price per sqm" THEN SUM([Price])/SUM([BuildingArea])
ELSEIF [Parameter Price or Room] = "Number of Rooms" THEN AVG([Rooms])
END
